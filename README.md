# Chess common mistakes

Only works on lichess games!

Don't make the same mistakes twice! (at least not in chess)

Have access to your most repeated mistakes (in the same position) and check the analyzed game in lichess.

Made with love in ***4 days*** with a team of **2 developers**.

# Goal and what it is.

A working analyzing tool, to check which mistakes any given lichess user repeats mutiple times. The goal is to be aware of the positions you may repeat in any game, and then know that you repeated the same mistakes in the same position a determined amount of times and how to get better on those positions going to the lichess board and studying the game.

## Recommended use:

- Use >50 numbers of games
- Ignore first 4 moves (meaning 2 for white and 2 for black)
- Score lost to consider an error means the score lost from the previous move to the actual move made. If the score is +3 after white moves, and black then moves and the score now is +6, then the score lost is 3.
- Minimum times the error is repeated: set this in at least two to get a nice feedback
